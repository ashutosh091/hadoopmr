If x is close to $% 2^n - 1 $% , we approximately need to check those $% 2^n $% numbers. Now let y be a n+m-bit prime, assuming the highest bit is not zero. We now increased the pool of numbers to check from $% 2^n $% to $%2^m \cdot 2^n$%, so by increasing the number of bits by m we get in the worst case $% 2^m $% more modulo operations.

8001893		cs387 	100000001	<p>Simple. They agree that say a negative integer denotes heads and positive one denotes tails. Alice picks an arbitrary large integer, k. Then she picks x = {-k, k} depending on the outcome of the coin toss, hashes that and sends it over to Bob. Now, in order for Bob to cheat, he needs to either guess the value k or hash all positive and negative integers and search for the hash Alice gave him. In order for Alice to cheat, she needs to find two integers k1, k2 such that H(k1) == H(-k2) or H(-k1) == H(k2). While neither feat is impossible, they both certainly are unfeasible, provided that H is perfect.</p>	answer	5339	5339	2012-04-28 01:45:26.674644+00	0		8024086	100000176	2012-04-28 05:44:22.403128+00	8002550	\N	\N	0	f

If the alphabet is ABC there are 6 possible keys, ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA.
